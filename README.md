# Coding_Problems-

These are my implementations of coding problems from various different sources including Cracking the Coding Interview, Elements of Programming Interviews, InterviewBit (website), LeetCode (website), TechieDelight (website). I am using cmake and CPPUTest to provide unit tests for each function which implements a solution to a problem. 

I am an embedded software engineer and I will do my best to also focus on providing exercises and solutions for problems I've encountered in my interviewing process and also problems I know have been asked in this domain. 

Hope you enjoy!
