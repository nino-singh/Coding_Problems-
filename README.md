# Coding_Problems-

These are my implementations of coding problems from various different sources including Cracking the Coding Interview, Elements of Programming Interviews, InterviewBit (website), LeetCode (website), TechieDelight (website). I am using cmake and CPPUTest to provide unit tests for each function which implements a solution to a problem. 

Hope you enjoy!
